Harness POC Overview
Why do a POC with Harness.io?
As our organization continues to innovate and expand, we recognize the need for more robust and scalable continuous delivery solutions. Harness.io, with its unique features like automated canary deployments, rollback capabilities, performance analysis, and continuous verification, presents a compelling case.

Purpose of POC
This Proof of Concept (POC) is designed to validate the potential benefits of Harness.io within our specific environment and use-cases. Through the POC, we aim to:

Evaluate Harness.io's functionality and compatibility with our existing systems.
Understand how Harness.io could improve our deployment speed and safety.
Test Harness.io's scalability and resilience under different deployment scenarios.

Objectives of Harness.io POC
Understanding Harness.io real-world scenarios
Our primary objective is to understand how Harness.io performs in a realistic production-like environment. By mimicking our existing workflows and deployment strategies, we aim to assess how Harness.io’s features like automated deployments, rollback mechanisms, and advanced deployment strategies can enhance our operational efficiency.

Integration Compatibility
Harness.io promises compatibility with a plethora of existing systems and tools. We aim to test these integrations to ensure a seamless transition. We'll analyze how effectively Harness.io interfaces with our current CI/CD pipeline, version control systems, monitoring tools, and notification channels.

Measure Efficiency and Effectiveness
Measure the potential efficiency gains and improvements in effectiveness brought about by Harness.io. By comparing key metrics such as deployment time, failure rate, and the time spent on manual intervention, we intend to quantify the benefits of implementing Harness.io in our production environment.

Scope of Harness POC
Automated Deployments
To minimize the impact of potential issues during deployment, we will explore the automated canary deployments feature of Harness.io. This will allow us to gradually roll out changes to a small subset of users before a full-scale deployment.

Template Application deployment: Basic familiarity with deploying K8 app in Harness
Docker Application deployment: Understand Harness deploying docker CC application
Deploying CC K8 App: Migrate existing CC docker app to K8 using Harness​​
Rollbacks
Harness.io's automatic rollback feature is crucial to ensuring service stability. During the POC, we will simulate deployment failures to test the efficacy and responsiveness of Harness.io's rollback mechanisms.

Performance Analysis
Harness.io offers AI-driven performance analysis. We will assess this feature by comparing performance metrics before and after deployments.

Continuous Verification
We will test Harness.io's ability to integrate with our existing monitoring tools to provide real-time feedback on deployments and post-deployment health checks.

Pipeline Visualization
To improve the visibility of our deployment process, we will evaluate the pipeline visualization capabilities of Harness.io, focusing on its clarity, user-friendliness, and effectiveness.

POC Environment and Parameters
For the POC, we will use a subset of our production environment, replicating real-world conditions without impacting our live services. Key parameters we will consider include:
Deployment Frequency: The frequency of deployments will be accelerated to generate sufficient data for evaluation.
Number of Services: We will choose a representative sample of our services for this POC to ensure a comprehensive test of Harness.io's features.
User Traffic Simulation: To adequately test canary deployments and rollback functionality, we will simulate various levels of user traffic and different scenarios.
Monitoring Integration: We will integrate Harness.io with our existing monitoring tools to test its compatibility and the effectiveness of continuous verification.

Harness POC Execution Plan
Steps for POC Execution
Setup and Configuration: We'll start by setting up Harness.io and integrating it with our existing CI/CD tools and infrastructure.
Feature Testing: Next, we'll create a series of real-world scenarios to test Harness.io’s key features, such as automated canary deployments, rollback capabilities, and observability tools.
Workflow Creation: We will create and run several deployment workflows using Harness.io to test its ease of use, flexibility, and automation capabilities.
Performance Monitoring: Throughout the POC, we'll monitor and document the performance of Harness.io, paying close attention to any improvements in deployment speed, failure rates, etc.

Success Criteria
Efficiency: At least 30% reduction in the time taken for deployments.
Reliability: A decrease in the number of deployment failures by 50%.
Ease of Use: The team should find Harness.io intuitive and easy to use, with a short learning curve.
Integration: Seamless integration with our existing CI/CD tools and infrastructure.
Visibility: Improved visibility into the deployment process and system health.

Timelines
Setup and Configuration: 1 week
Feature Testing and Workflow Creation: 2 weeks
Evaluation and Reporting: 1 week
